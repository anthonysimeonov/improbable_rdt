# Improbable Real (Robot) Deployment Tools \[RDT\]

Python Package containing tools for interfacing with the real world in learning experiments. Avoiding the use of ROS here. 
- Interfacing with robots (primarily the Franka Panda)
    - Utilities for using the `polymetis` package for interacing with the Panda
- Interfacing with RGB(-D) cameras (such as RealSense, potentially Kinect)
- Motion planning
- Inverse kinematics
- LCM message passing
- etc.
